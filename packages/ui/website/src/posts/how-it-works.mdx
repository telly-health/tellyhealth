### Right now, the situation in Asia Pacific is dire, with millions of new COVID-19 cases being reported daily.

Families are losing loved ones, there is a critical shortage of oxygen and the country’s healthcare system is at breaking point.

The Covid-19 pandemic has added additional stress for an overburdened healthcare workforce. 

The worldwide telehealth solution is sorely in need of impacted country at the moment of crisis. This would enable global shared healthcare support for people across the globe. 

As lockdown measures have strictened across the Asia Pacific countries, people have no access to bare minimum medical consultation for any illness.

We want to enable group telehealth consultation for routine care through `telly.health` platform that could simultaneously save time and support people during crisis.

### What are group telehealth consultation?

Group tele consultations are a sustainable alternative to current primary care practice of seeing people one to one. They make it possible for the practice team to support people in the way they want AND simultaneously reduce clinician workload, thus creating access and continuity of care for patients. 

### How does it work? 

Group consultations are led by a medical practitoner. The clinician creates a group consultation to invite people with similar condition.

Prior to the joining the group consultation, people should have provided the health tests report if neccessary, so clinican can assist based on ‘their numbers’ e.g. Hba1c, cholesterol.

The clinician joins 20 – 30 minutes prior to the session to review the people's reports and queries.

The clinician then holds brief 1:1 consultations with each of the participants in the group setting. They usually raise no more than one or two questions. This session lasts for allocated 45-60 minutes. Everyone listens and learns from the conversation and advice given to everyone in the group.

We are in need of medical practitoners across the globe to participate and support us.
